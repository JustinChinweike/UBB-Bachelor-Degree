Problems
1. Design a webpage displaying a grid-like mosaic composed of irregularly shaped tiles,
each featuring a dynamically distorted gradient.
The tiles should react to mouse interaction with unique visual transformations,
creating a sense of fluid motion and depth.



2. Write a web page which should contain on a row several thumbnail images and above that row
should contain a larger image. If the mouse is over a thumbnail image, the larger version of
that image should appear above it.
