# Bank Accounts

At a bank, we have to keep track of the balance of several accounts.

We run concurrent transfer operations executed on multiple threads.  
Each operation transfers a given amount of money from one account to another.

From time to time, as well as at the end of the program, a **consistency check** is performed to verify that the **total amount of money in all accounts** remains the same as in the beginning.

# Requirements Summary

-  Use multiple threads to perform random transfer operations on shared data.  
- Protect shared data using mutexes to avoid race conditions.  
- Ensure invariants hold â€” total balance must remain constant.  
- Threads must run independently where possible (**fine-grained locking**).  
- Main thread waits for all worker threads to finish, then verifies consistency.  
- Performance experiments should vary **thread count** and **locking granularity**.
